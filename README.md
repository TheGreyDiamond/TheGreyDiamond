I'm intersted in anything techy! Here a short list of stuff I work with:
- Affinity Photo
- grandMA onPC (Love it, but a bit expensiv and hard to learn)
- Blender (Amazing software, I like it)
- Arduinos and ESP8266/ESP32 (Still doing it, quite cool)
- I really love event lighting (for stages)

This list would go on for ever, so....

Maybe checkout [Project-Name-Here](https://www.project-name-here.de)

Don't worry and be happy! ✨
