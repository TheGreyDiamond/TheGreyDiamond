### Hi there 👋
I'm TheGreyDiamond, a german student!👨‍💻 I love coding in Python. Consider to visit me on..  
- ⚡ .. my Website: TheGreydiamond.de
- 💬 .. my Twitter : @TheGreydiamond2  (I you need to reach out to me, this is a good place!)
- 😄 .. my Discordserver: https://discord.gg/zWHaAtJ (But why a server? My tag changes very often, so a server is way easier. You can reach me here too!)
- ☄️ .. my twitch channel: https://twitch.tv/greydiamond (sometimes german, sometimes english)
- 🛸 .. my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7zasBuVtQMNPkFgt9eYu6g (only german at the moment)

I'm intersted in anything techy! Here a short list of stuff I tried:
- Terragen (Love it but a lot to learn)
- grandMA onPC (Love it, but a bit expensiv and hard to learn)
- Blender (Amazing software, I like it)
- Unity (Well...)
- Arduinos and ESP8266 (Still doing it, quite cool)
- I really love event lighting (for stages)
This list would go on for ever, so....


Don't worry and be happy! ✨
