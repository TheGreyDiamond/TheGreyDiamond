### Hi there 👋
I'm TheGreyDiamond, a student from Germany!👨‍💻 I love coding in Python. Consider to visit me on..

- 💬 .. my Twitter : @TheGreydiamond2  (If you need to reach out to me, this is a good place!)
- 😄 .. my Discordserver: https://discord.gg/zWHaAtJ (But why a server? My tag changes sometimes, so a server is way easier. You can reach me here too!)

- 🛸 .. my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7zasBuVtQMNPkFgt9eYu6g (only german at the moment)

BTW I work at Wavelens (https://wavelens.io)! Check us out!

I'm intersted in anything techy! Here a short list of stuff I tried:
- Terragen (Love it but a lot to learn)
- grandMA onPC (Love it, but a bit expensiv and hard to learn)
- Blender (Amazing software, I like it)
- Unity (Well...)
- Arduinos and ESP8266/ESP32 (Still doing it, quite cool)
- I really love event lighting (for stages)

This list would go on for ever, so....


Don't worry and be happy! ✨
